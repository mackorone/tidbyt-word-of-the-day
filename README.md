# tidbyt-word-of-the-day
A word-of-the-day app for [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/), built on top of
Merriam-Webster's [Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day).

I took some inspiration from the
[Spritz](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spritz-app/id1486315785) app.

## Quick start
1. Install [`pixlet`](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet)
1. Run `pixlet serve word_of_the_day.star`
1. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
